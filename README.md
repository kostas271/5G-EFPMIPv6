# 5G Enhanced FPMIPv6(EFPMIPv6) VS FPMIPv6
This code presents an improved model for handovers in order to reduce the delay and packet loss present in the handover process. The improved model is compared to the standard handover models by utilizing mathematical models results are extracted about the efficiency of the improved model.

The code is developed in MATLAB and simulates the procedure of exchanging the required signaling messages so that a mobile node can perform handover from a previous access point to the next. The simulation is done for the standard FPMIPv6 protocol as well as the Enhanched protocol so that we can compare the results in Packet Loss, Handover Latency and Handover Cost.
